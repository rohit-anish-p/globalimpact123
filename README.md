# üåç "What-If" Carbon Simulator

**Live Demo:** [**https://globalimpact123.streamlit.app/**](https://globalimpact123.streamlit.app/)

---

A simple AI-powered app to understand the real-world impact of your climate actions. Built for the **UN SDG Goal 13 (Climate Action)**.

This app allows you to ask simple, "what-if" questions in plain English to see the estimated carbon (CO2) savings of a lifestyle change over one year.



## üí° What It Does

Instead of just calculating your past carbon footprint, this tool helps you simulate future changes. The AI provides an estimated annual CO2 saving and translates it into a relatable analogy.

You can ask questions like:
* "What if I stop eating beef and switch to chicken?"
* "What if I switch from my petrol car to a bus for my 20km daily commute?"
* "What if I switch my 5 most-used bulbs to LEDs?"
